== Client-Side Widgets

This chapter gives basic documentation on the use of the Vaadin client-side
framework for the purposes of creating client-side applications and writing your
own widgets.

__We only give a brief introduction to the topic in this chapter. Please refer
to the GWT documentation for a more complete treatment of the GWT widgets.__
