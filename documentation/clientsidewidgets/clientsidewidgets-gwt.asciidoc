GWT widgets are user interface elements that are rendered as HTML. Rendering is
done either by manipulating the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) through the
lower-level DOM API, or simply by injecting the HTML with
[methodname]#setInnerHTML()#. The layout of the user interface is managed using
special panel widgets.

For information about the basic GWT widgets, please refer to the GWT Developer's
Guide at https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUi.
