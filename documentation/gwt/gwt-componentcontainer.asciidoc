= Component Containers

Component containers, such as layout components, are a special group of
components that require some consideration. In addition to handling state, they
need to manage communicating the hierarchy of their contained components to the
other side.

The easiest way to implement a component container is extend the
[classname]#AbstractComponentContainer#, which handles the synchronization of
the container server-side components to the client-side.
